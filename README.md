# RVPN Server

Branch: restructured
--------------------
* restructure into various packages, removing items from package "main"
* used caddy source as a guide
* weird debugging issue introduced, will not halt, break point unverified.
* although a test project debugs just fin

listener_client â€” the WSS client
- removed support for anything admin
- injected the domains from the claim 
- domains are now included as initialDomains
- registration performans as normal but includes adding the domains to a map of domains, and a collection of domains on the connection.
- the system now supports look up fast in either direction, not sure if it will be needed.
- reads a chan during registration before allowing traffic, making sure all is well.
- registration returns a true on the channel if all is well. If it is not, false. Likely will add some text to pass back.

Connection
- added support for boolean channel
- support for initial domains in a slice, these are brought back from the JWT as a interface and then are type asserted into the map
- removed all the old timer sender dwell stuff as a POC for traffic counts.

ConnectionTable
- added support for domain announcement after the WSS is connection. Not sure if we will need these. They have not been implemented.
- I assume all domains are registered with JWT unless I hear differently which would require a new WSS session
- expanded NewTable constructor
- populating domains into the domain map, and into the connection slice.
- added support for removing domains when a connection is removed.

Packer
- added support for a PackerHeader type and PackerData type
- these are connected in a Packer type
- support for calculated address family based on ip address property
- service field is set to "na"

Logging
- unified package logging based on a package init.  Will likely need to remove this

Tests
- stared to structure project for tests.  


Build Instructions
------------------

Create a subinterface:
```bash
sudo ifconfig lo0 alias 127.0.0.2 up
```
The above creates an alias the code is able to bind against for admin.  Admin is still in progress.

Get the dependencies

```bash
go get github.com/gorilla/websocket
go get github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go

git clone git@git.daplie.com:Daplie/localhost.daplie.me-certificates.git 
ln -s localhost.daplie.me-certificates/certs/localhost.daplie.me certs
```

Run the VPN
```bash
go build && ./go-rvpn-server
```

In another terminal execute the client
``` bash
bin/stunnel.js --locals http:hfc.daplie.me:3000,http://test.hfc.daplie.me:3001 --stunneld wss://localhost.daplie.me:8000 --secret abc123
```

Connection to the External Interface.

The request is dumped to stdio.  This is in preparation of taking that request and sending it back to the designated WSS connection
The system needs to track the response coming back, decouple it, and place it back on the wire in the form of a response stream.  Since

A Poor Man's Reverse VPN written in Go

Context
-------

Even in the worst of conditions the fanciest of firewalls can't stop a WebSocket
running over https from creating a secure tunnel.

Whether at home behind a router that lacks UPnP compliance, at school, work,
the library - or even on an airplane, we want any device (or even a browser or
app) to be able to serve from anywhere.

Motivation
----------

We originally wrote this in node.js as
[node-tunnel-server](https://git.daplie.com/Daplie/node-tunnel-server),
but there are a few problems:

* metering
* resource utilization
* binary transfer

### metering

We want to be able to meter all traffic on a socket.
In node.js it wasn't feasible to be able to track the original socket handle
all the way back from the web socket authentication through the various
wrappers.

A user connects via a websocket to the tunnel server
and an authentication token is presented.
If the connection is established the socket should then be metered and reported
including total bytes sent and received and size of payload bytes sent and
received (because the tunnelling adds some overhead).

### resource utilization

node.js does not support usage of multiple cores in-process.
The overhead of passing socket connections between processes seemed non-trivial
at best and likely much less efficient, and impossible at worst.

### binary transfer

node.js doesn't handle binary data very well. People will be transferring
gigabytes of data.

Short Term Goal
----

Build a server compatible with the node.js client (JWT authentication)
that can meter authenticated connections, utilize multiple cores efficiently,
and efficienty garbage collect gigabytes upon gigabytes of transfer.
